# cs30 major project proposal

## needed/required
 - elements of everything we've learned in class []
 - _timer_ to count how long the target is displayed
 - _targets_ that spawn in a random position each time
 - _reset_ button or function that will restart the game***
## not required/nice to have
- _score keeper_
- _timer_ that corresponds with the size of a target
- _deathscreen_***

***reset and deathscreen are essentially doing the same function but the deathscreen would be far more aesthetically pleasing.***
